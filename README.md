# Petmatch [WIP]
A sample ReactNative application for contacting pet owners

## Important note
This is a WIP project and is by no means a fully functional product

## Main characteristics
Petmatch is an application for pet owners interested in posting info about their pets with
the goals of mating or adopting. 

The user posts detailed info including the type of pet (dog, cat), its breed, sex and age, 
with the possibility of posting a picture. These posts are listed on the main page so other users of the app are able to select the ones that are
of interest. 

The app should notify a user when someone hits the "Like" button on the post and so 
begin a contact, for example via an itegrated chat room.

## Technical info
Petmatch is an Expo based app
